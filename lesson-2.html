                                Badminton is a tennis-like game played with light stroke rackets that are used to strike
                                a shuttlecock (a feather cork missile) back and forth, before it hits the ground across
                                a high net within a rectangular court. It is also a court play that can be played either
                                singles or doubles, by men, women or mixed pairs, either indoors or on outdoor courts as
                                a fun game.

                                Badminton originated from the ancient civilizations of Europe mainly in England. It was
                                brought to England about 1870 by British army officers stationed in India. Badminton is
                                an ancient game known as Battledore (bat or paddle) and Shuttlecock originated more than
                                2000 years ago. The game was learned in India as “poona”. Battledore and Shuttlecock
                                were simply played by two people hitting a shuttlecock backwards and forwards with a
                                simple bat as many times as they could without allowing it to hit the ground.

                                <strong>Badminton racket</strong> is quite light and can be made of wood, aluminum,
                                metal or synthetic
                                material such as graphite of carbon. A badminton racket weighs roughly 98-100 grams and
                                68 cm in length. Most strings are made of synthetic such as nylon but world class
                                players use lamb. String diameter ranges from 19-22 gauge. Most competitive players
                                prefer 21 to 22 gauge string at 14 to 15 pounds of tension, that provides power and
                                control. For school and recreational use, with 20 gauge string at a tension of 12 to 13
                                pounds is adequate.

                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>“Player” applies to all those taking part in the match.</li>
                                <li>The game shall be played, in the case of doubles, by two players a side, or in
                                    the case of singles, by one player a side.</li>
                                <li>The side having the right to serve shall be called the serving side and the
                                    opposing side shall be called the receiving side.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h5>2. Toss</h5>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>Before commencing the play, the opposing sides shall toss a coin, spin a racket,
                                    or toss a shuttle, to determine who shall exercise the choice in either Rule 1 or
                                    Rule 2. <br>

                            <p>The rally point system is used in scoring the badminton game which means any fault
                                committed by the serving or receiving team gains point.</p>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>A match consists of the best 3 games of 21 points.</li>
                                <li>Every time there is a serve – there is a point scored.</li>
                                <li>The side winning a rally adds a point to its score.</li>
                                <li>At 20 all, the side which gains a 2 point lead first, wins that game.</li>
                                <li>At 29 all, the side scoring the 30th point, wins that game.</li>
                                <li>The side winning a game serves first in the next game.</li>

                                <li>Only the receiver shall return the service; should the shuttle touch or is hit by

                                        <li>After the service is returned, the player may hit the shuttle from any

                                    will change service after they lose a rally.</li>
                                <li>The server changes courts after every point his team wins. The receiving side

                                    side may be positioned in the right court to receive.</li>
