                            <h4><strong>Laws and Policies to Prevent Substance Use</strong></h4>

                            <p><strong>Drug abuse</strong> is <em>a critical issue that affects individuals, families,
                                    and
                                    communities worldwide</em>. Addressing this challenge requires a <em>comprehensive,
                                    multi-faceted approach</em>. This conceptual framework outlines key strategies and
                                programs implemented to prevent and control drug abuse through the engagement of
                                families,
                                schools, youth, and communities. By empowering parents, leveraging the influence of
                                senior
                                citizens, mobilizing youth, and strengthening community-based interventions, this
                                framework
                                aims to create a cohesive and sustainable defense against drug abuse.</p>

                            <h5><strong>1. Family as First Line of Defense-</strong></h5>
                            <p>The family plays the most important role in protecting children and youth from drug
                                abuse.
                                Parents, guardians, and family members are the first influence on a child's behavior,
                                values, and decision-making. A strong, supportive family helps reduce the risk of drug
                                use
                                and other risky behaviors.</p>

                            <p><strong>Systematic Training for Effective Parenting (STEP) -</strong> This program equips
                                parents with the knowledge and skills they need to raise responsible and resilient
                                children.
                                It has three main components:</p>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>Parents attend workshops or seminars on communication, discipline, and empathy.
                                    These
                                    sessions help build trust, understanding, and open communication between parents and
                                    children. When parents and children have a good relationship, the child feels
                                    supported
                                    and less likely to engage in drug use.</li>
                                <li>Parents are given learning materials about the dangers of drugs, peer pressure, and
                                    how
                                    to guide their children wisely. This helps families make better, informed decisions
                                    and
                                    recognize early warning signs of drug abuse.</li>
                                <li>Parents and youth come together through associations or community groups. They share
                                    experiences, support one another, and organize activities promoting healthy
                                    lifestyles.
                                    This builds a network of support that helps sustain prevention efforts and keeps
                                    families' drug-free. When families are educated, trained, and connected, they become
                                    stronger and more capable of preventing drug abuse.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h5><strong>2. Senior Citizens as Advocates -</strong></h5>
                            <p>Senior citizens are viewed as influential figures in the community. Because of their
                                experience, wisdom, and respect from others, they can serve as advocates for drug abuse
                                prevention.</p>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>Senior citizens are trained to speak up, educate others, and spread awareness about
                                    the
                                    dangers of drug use. They learn how to effectively communicate prevention messages
                                    and
                                    influence others positively. Once trained, they can reach out to families, schools,
                                    and
                                    other groups to educate and engage the community about staying drug-free.</li>
                                <li>Senior citizens participate actively in local programs, events, and initiatives
                                    related
                                    to drug prevention. They collaborate with other community members to strengthen the
                                    collective response to drug issues. Their involvement encourages younger generations
                                    and
                                    families to choose healthy, drug-free behaviors and build supportive environments.

                            </ol>

                            <p>This part focuses on school-based programs that empower young people to take part in drug
                                prevention efforts.</p>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>Students form peer groups (like Barkada Kontra Droga) that promote a drug-free
                                    lifestyle. These groups encourage one another to make healthy choices and create a
                                    support network among friends. Through peer influence, they spread awareness and
                                    discourage drug use within their circles.</li>
                                <li>The National Drug Education Program (NDEP) is integrated into school lessons. It
                                    provides students with accurate information about drugs, their harmful effects, and
                                    ways
                                    to resist peer pressure. This leads to informed and responsible youth who understand
                                    the
                                    importance of staying drug-free.</li>
                                <li>Students are trained in decision-making, communication, problem-solving, and coping
                                    skills. These life skills help them manage stress, avoid risky behavior, and make
                                    wise
                                    choices. As a result, youth become confident and empowered to lead positive,
                                    drug-free
                                    lives.</li>

                                in drug prevention.</p>

                                <li>The National Youth Congress gathers young leaders from different regions. They share

                                    schools
                                    and communities. This promotes teamwork and cooperation among youth organizations

                                <li>Students and youth leaders receive standardized training on leadership, advocacy,

                                    anti-drug campaigns. This ensures that prevention programs across schools follow the
                                    same high-quality standards. The goal is to sustain consistent and effective

                                    that reach more students and communities. Through education, leadership, peer

                                    empowered

                            <p>This approach recognizes that young people are key partners in preventing drug abuse. By
                                engaging them through schools, media, and events, the program aims to build awareness
                                and
